# BUS443_FinalProject
Final Project Submission - Web Page Application

Author - Matt Spivey

The objective: To build a student information app with the Django framework.

Once authenticated via login, the user can access a dashboard with dynamically populated student and course statistics,
see a student directory on the Student Details page, see a course catalogue on the Course Details page, and Enroll in courses
on the Student Enrollment page. Error handling limits enrollment to limit students to three enrolled classes each, and ensures 
students aren't enrolled in the same course twice.

Room foor improvement: If this project is revisited, I would add the ability to un-enroll a student from a course much in the same 
                       way they can enroll. I would also make improvements in the the amount of statistics displayed on the dashboard, and                        improvements in the way of styling and appearance.
